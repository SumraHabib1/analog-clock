for hour hand:
12hrs=360 deg rotation
1hr=360/12= 30 deg rotation
so for h hrs =30h degree +  ---
but hour end will rotae some extra bcz of min will also rotate so
60 min= 30 deg rotation
1 min= 1/2 degree 
m min=m/2 degree
so the rotation will be = 30h+m/2 
for min hand:
for 60 min =360 deg rotation
for 1 min =360/60 =6 deg rotation
for m min=6m deg rotation
second hand:
60 sec=360 deg rotation
1 sec=360/60 =6 deg rotation
for s sec =6s
